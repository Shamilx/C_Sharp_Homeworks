First of all i need to say that i dont know how to play a card game so i designed my game to be different from original card game,Logic : 

   4       3         2         1
spades > hearts > diamonds > clubs

And 
 4            3  
spades,5 vs hearts,2

4 + 5 > 3 + 2

So spades wins

But hearts will win if the number of hearts is bigger than 6,and this is impossible(Because of my game logic)

Jake : 4 points
Queen : 5 points
King : 6 points

Cards class has two ctor :

1)string TypeOfCard,int NumberOfCard - parametrs of first ctor send like : spades,5
2)string NameOfCard,string TypeOfCard - parametrs of second ctor send like : jake,hearts

For further info check Card.cs in source folder...
